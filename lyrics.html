                <p class="lyrics off">can’t seem to find space in the line
  out the box i climb
  might see you later
  i spend the day tryna be okay
  easier to say but i think i’m getting better
  yes i’m still alive
  praise the divine
  great by design 
  but sometimes i don’t feel that way
  feel that brave

  thought i needed saving
  (i thought that i need saving, i didn’t, i didn’t)
  i was slowly fading, like colours out the painting
  i was busy waiting on me
  i was hesitating on dreams
  forgot what i was chasing
  still tryna find

  thought i knew then i found a new void
  faced with a new choice
  lotta questions lately on this odyssey
  i don’t wanna feel, i just wanna breathe
  i’ve been self aware since i lost my baby teeth
  i’m steady on my grind
  i got a way to climb
  rules i need to lose and answers that i hope to find
  pay me to overthink, i’ll tell you everything
  memory becomes a melody

  listen close baby
  we both know what you’re really worth
  more than you believe
  i can take it from here if you just tell me
  tell (me now)
  tell me what you need
  tell me what are you here for?
  you bleed, you’re alive, what are you waiting for?

  can’t seem to find space in the line
  out the box i climb (i climb)
  praise the divine on this odyssey
  feel it getting deeper
  and deep down you know that you could be her
  it started as a feeling
  but now i got a vision ain’t a soul that can stop me (no)

  send the car i’m on the way
  heading far so overtake
  take the fast lane
  please don’t crash babe
  turn it up nah ain’t no going back babe
  going back, no going back babe
  turn it up nah aint no going back babe
  going back, no going back babe
  on this odyssey

  dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
  dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
  nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah.

                </p>
                <p class="lyrics off">oh, time keeps running away
  and all i wanna do is escape
  (i feel less each breath i take)
  oh, nightmares when i’m awake
  reality’s starting to shake
  (so much noise that i can’t think)

  i feel like alice in the borderland
  tryna be a superman
  fool me once, fool me twice
  queen of castles in the sand
  system ‘bout to overload
  fallin’ down the rabbit hole
  swear the room is getting wetter, baby i’m emotional

  sweet like sugar
  tough like candy
  wishing i was high
  something’s coming over me
  caught up in my head again
  you say i should know better
  i just make reality a little more negotiable

  oh, time keeps running away
  and all i wanna do is escape
  (i feel less each breath i take)
  oh, nightmares when i’m awake
  reality’s starting to shake
  (so much noise that i can’t think)

  yeah yeah yeah
  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
  i’m running out of time
  baby we’re out of time

  trying to decide what i’m feeling
  hiding never sounded so appealing
  think i’m better off down the rabbit hole today
  sweet like sugar (sweet like sugar yeah)
  wishing i was high
  caught up in my head again
  you say i should know better
  i just make reality a little more negotiable.

                </p>
                <p class="lyrics off">what’s the meaning?
  every day i wake up wondering
  what’s the meaning?
  and i get out of bed but i can’t shake the feeling
  that something in the tone i’m speaking is revealing
  that i do things i don’t believe in

  my head gets the best of me
  and i forget who i am
  and it gets harder to see
  i just don’t understand
  it’s hypnotising, oh so deceiving
  i get the feeling this ain’t how it’s s’posed to be

  i go to work again
  when i’m in doubt i go to work again
  this is the language that i understand
  can’t find the reason i’m so uncontent
  all of these voices gon’ know who i am
  i can feel the fire burning 
  and yet here we go again
  i been locked inside my mind but it’s an open cage
  you could try to find to find a reason
  you can try to run away
  but you gon’ be in trouble just the same

  best believe it
  it takes one to know one
  you can’t hide or seek it
  life don’t work that way
  don’t make me face my demons
  i been tryna grow, but oh it ain’t the season
  and at the most i’m breaking even

  my head gets the best of me
  and i forget who i am
  and it gets harder to see
  i just don’t understand
  it’s hypnotising, oh so deceiving
  i get the feeling this is how it’s gonna be from now

  can’t run from myself
  (can’t run away)
  there ain’t no way out
  there ain’t no way out
  (jsmine sophia)
  the only time is now

  i go to work again
  when i’m in doubt i go to work again
  this is the language that i understand
  can’t find the reason i’m so uncontent
  all of these voices, 
  they know i go to work again
  when i’m in doubt i go to work again
  this is the language that i understand
  can’t find the reason i’m so uncontent, ohhh

  i been breathing, i’m bleeding, i’m bleeding
  and i’m on my knees to the lord and i’m pleading
  i wish that i could understand, ohhh.

                </p>
                <p class="lyrics off">as i raise my tone 
  the adrenaline rushes through my veins
  how dare you disturb my peace again

  wake me up
  baby let’s go back in time
  tastes like trouble waiting for me to take a bite

  don’t wanna hear it
  don’t wanna know that it’s not your fault
  (again, again, again, again, again)
  boy you could be anything, anything
  but you wanna break my heart in the process

  don’t be my lover, lover, lover
  lover, lover, lover
  love is a dangerous game
  don’t need a lover, lover, lover
  so love her, love her, love her,
  lover,
  not just another lover, lover, lover 

  don’t need you in my life
  think that i’ll be good this time
  even if the sun don’t shine
  i know i’m gonna be alright
  and nobody could take your place
  but i think i need a little more space
  gotta do it on my own this time, it’s time

  i do my breathwork and i count to ten
  does more than the texts you used to send
  feel like myself again and i hope you’ll understand

  don’t be my lover, lover, lover
  lover, lover, lover
  love is a dangerous game
  don’t need a lover, lover, lover
  so love her, love her, love her,
  lover,
  not just another lover, lover, lover 

  last night i realised i sugarcoated you in my mind
  words are nice but i prefer reading between the lines
  had me thinking this was love
  baby you became my great escape
  i just blew your cover
  now you can be anything

  but don’t be my lover, lover, lover
  lover, lover, lover
  love is a dangerous game
  don’t need a lover, lover, lover
  so love her, love her, love her,
  lover,
  not just another lover, 
  don’t be my lover, lover, lover
  lover, lover, lover
  love is a dangerous game
  don’t need a lover, lover, lover
  so love her, love her, love her,
  lover,
  not just another lover, lover, lover.

                <p class="lyrics off">having a decisive or crucial importance
  in the success, failure, or existence of something
  my mind is critical to my experience of life
  and to this world we are all critical

  yeah i’m critical, i’m critical
  i’m on the edge and there ain’t no going back
  my dreams are vivid when i’m vulnerable
  my life i live it, know i’m on the right path
  the world’s an open void
  breathe into every moment just as you are
  in all that you, in all that you
  in all that you are

  cause you’re critical, you’re critical
  and you don’t need no permission, no 
  to take it slow
  go off the grid
  don’t waste your time feeling bad
  no it ain’t that bad if it means i’m still alive
  what i’m tryna say is baby it’s okay to feel
  in my mind all day 
  need patience as i take a step back
  i’ll breathe then watch me grow back
  now i’m ten times stronger

  i’ll be in the shower spacing out
  wondering how my day’s gonna play out
  thinking bout everything apart from the present 
  when the water runs cold, unaware of how long i’ve been
  i think that i was born with superpowers
  extraordinary ability to think for hours
  i used to think i was my mind, these days i doubt her
  and i’m ten times stronger

  (ooh, yeah)
  yeah i’m critical, i’m critical
  (ooh, yeah)
  i’m on the edge and there ain’t no going back
  (ooh, yeah)
  my dreams are vivid when i’m vulnerable
  (ooh, yeah)
  my life i live it, know i’m on the right path

  will i find the answer?
  will i lose my way?
  hard to say

  yeah i’m critical, i’m critical
  i’m on the edge and there ain’t no going back
  my dreams are vivid when i’m vulnerable
  my life i live it, know i’m on the right path
  the world’s an open void
  breathe into every moment just as you are
  in all that you, in all that you
  in all that you are

  yeah you so fine
  sunshine, so much sunshine

  sunshine, you’re my sunshine
  just like red wine 
  yeah you so fine
  sunshine, so much sunshine
  you’re my (you’re my, you’re my)

  head in the clouds
  stuck on a train
  all i spy with my little eye is the rain
  wherever it falls, just know that i’d risk it all
  honey give me a call
  so won’t you save me a little time
  mr weatherman, can i make you mine?
  at least i’m not wet
  at least i’m not yet
  just bought some new shampoo gonna make me shine

  sunshine, you’re my sunshine

  yeah you so fine

                  daylight is gone but the darkness is late
                  stars have come out but i wish they would wait
                  praying for some kind of shelter there’s nowhere to hide
                  too many of us are running away from the things deep inside
                  inside (hums)
                  
                  people around you they try to relate
                  won’t leave you alone keep on calling your phone
                  but there’s nothing to say
                  when time is on hold i get wrapped up in thoughts 
                  that don’t do much but keep me inside
                  praying for some kind of shelter there’s nowhere to hide
                  
                  winter goes on
                  i make it mine
                  can’t do me wrong
                  you won’t sleep right, won’t sleep right
                  i open my wings to the sky
                  into the dark of the night
                  i’ll fly
                  
                  too many nights i don’t know if i’m alive
                  too many nights i don’t know
                  but this movie is starting to roll
                  and i’m playing the starring role
                  fear my old friend, i can’t stay
                  it’s time that we went our own ways
                  i’m ready to go
                  and though it’s looking cold
                  this coat works for me and i hope you like drinking alone, alone, alone
                  
                  walk in the room like a gangster
                  don’t ever question my hunger
                  destiny calls and i answer
                  she told me that i could be stronger
                  like winter, yeah i’m so numb
                  anxiety is falling off
                  nobody like me, i’m all alone
                  here in the ring i can do anything
                  i been doin’ okay
                  mindin’ my lane
                  i got music on my brain and i didn’t come here to play
                  this **** ain’t new to me oh no i breathe melodies
                  meditate on my dreams
                  elevate every chance that i receive
                  oh, i’m moving forward
                  i’m on the road
                  now i’m smiling and that’s cause i know
                  there’s only one way this can go
                  prepare for the storm
                  
                  walk in the room like a gangster
                  don’t ever question my hunger, no
                  don’t ever question that ****, don’t even
                  don’t even question me
                  no, no, no, no.

                <p class="lyrics off">love’s an illusion
                  one i’m inside
                  threw down my guard then 
                  gave you the knife
                  i was mistaken
                  i was mistaken, oh
                  
                  dancing in moonlight
                  dressed to the nines
                  mapping locations i thought we would fly
                  but i didn’t know that your heart was vacant
                  until you stole my last life
                  
                  what is love? cause i’m all ears
                  oh what is love without the tears?
                  is it just a word i borrowed
                  or did i make it up?
                  what would you call it then
                  when we know we’re more than friends
                  when you sell me all your dreams
                  and i give you everything?
                  
                  i’ve been losing sleep
                  and my peace of mind
                  went from counting sheep to counting lies
                  no more story telling
                  no more second chances
                  no more fantasizing that we’ll run away
                  leave all this behind
                  we’ll use a fake ID to buy us some time
                  you tell me tomorrow
                  but somewhere in my brain
                  i know that to you this is all just a game
                  
                  what is love? cause i’m all ears
                  what is love without the tears?
                  i confess i’m starting to think i made it up, love…
                  what would you call it then
                  when we know we’re more than friends?
                  i should draw the line cause the one we have is blurry
                  
                  sorry, sorry, sorry
                  sorry for the ********
                  sorry i don’t need you
                  and sorry that i’m done with this
                  sorry i’m not sorry 
                  for putting things so bluntly
                  the way you think you’re tough
                  you’re scared to love
                  in case it ends
                  in case it ends.

                  getting closer and closer 
                  i think i’m spilling over
                  my feelings are rising 
                  go on and sound the siren
                  feeling dangerous
                  found myself a ride or die
                  keep him nameless 
                  i gotta watch that evil eye
                  
                  no box can contain me
                  don’t blame me for blurring your dead lines
                  i’m tucking the demons in under the rubble it’s bedtime
                  get out of my head and into the tomb
                  off with the gloves, call up the wolves
                  and tell them the empress has got a new groove (skrrr)
                  and while i’m plotting my moves
                  let ‘em know that i make up the rules
                  never watching the views
                  i’m so hungry i’m eating for two
                  there’s room here for you
                  there’s room for me too
                  i hate that the women think winning involves competition, it’s dumb
                  i can’t help but feel that the men shouldn’t get to have all of the fun
                  get out of your way 
                  i’m talking to you
                  what do you say?
                  who could you be?
                  look in the mirror and who do you see?

                  sweeter things will come and go
                  but cavities and calories suppressing my desire
                  when the lights all gone in the wasteland pearly eyes just can’t see a thing
                  clinging to our hope as we roam the open plane 
                  that we will see the light of day

                  riders outside but their eyes are empty
                  as they try to shoot me blind
                  devil starts to cry cause his words don’t tempt me

                  i am alone again
                  the leaves, my friends
                  they all go in the end
                  i let them go, i don’t hold on
                  cause i know better than to try and fight the weather on my own
                  
                  i breathe
                  and i pray that one day
                  i’ll find a better way
                  when the world ain’t so loud
                  and my mind’s a little less tired
                  i’ll find remedies to all these wounds that i’ve acquired
                  so i have faith even when i’m in doubt
                  that all of my dreams are gonna work out
                  unlikely as it seems, brushing dust of the shelf
                  i might just need a moment to remind myself
                  
                  i breathe
                  i am alone again
                  the leaves, my friends
                  they all go in the end
                  i let them go, i don’t hold on
                  cause i know better than to try and fight the weather on my own
                  
                  i breathe
                  and feel, as the waves slowly recede
                  back to ripples in the stream
                  glitching pixels on the screen won’t stop me seeing
                  the light as darkness fades
                  the smile upon your face
                  when nothing hurts anymore, anymore
                  so i feel free, i’m alone
                  and no matter where i go i know that i’m home
                  i just need a moment to take it slow
                  
                  i breathe 
                  i am alone again

                  they all go in the end
                  i let them go, i don’t hold on
                  cause i know better than to try and fight the weather on my own
                  
                  (interlude)
                  
                  so i sing this song and i hope i’ll find
                  a way to get through the night
                  cause if i close my eyes
                  i’m afraid i might not breathe.
