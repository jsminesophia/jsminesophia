                <p class="lyrics off">Capricorn, very nice to meet you
                  here’s a song
                  for the nights you lie awake
                  no sleep to find
                  hungry for peace of mind
                  why don’t we play it one more time?
                  
                  Innocent
                  so innocent
                  until it weren’t
                  now I can’t walk away
                  and when I dream
                  I only dream about you
                  I wish you knew what I was tryna say
                  
                  And if you feel better then
                  we don’t have to talk about it
                  it will be over when its over,
                  alright, alright, alright
                  
                  Cause some nights i barely recognise
                  when i can’t hide from the noise that pulls me under
                  only one call i’m makin’
                  then you pick up, so i reply…
                  
                  Bring the smoke, come over
                  let’s stay up all night, all night, all night
                  ain’t no rules here on this sofa
                  are you ready for the ride?
                  
                  Pullin up, ten o’clock
                  bringing that good green with you
                  role it up, spark it up
                  then we go puff puff pass it on
                  eyes are locked, til we are
                  out of our minds its about damn time
                  partner in crime up on cloud nine
                  leave the world behind
                  
                  I cannot sleep tonight
                  I’m feeling weak tonight
                  blowing on trees inside
                  i be up acting like i don’t feel a way
                  you’ll be the one that got away
                  i’ll be the bad guy, that’s okay
                  (hey)
                  
                  Bring the smoke, come over
                  let’s stay up all night, all night, all night
                  ain’t no rules here on this sofa
                  are you ready for the ride?

                  daylight is gone but the darkness is late
                  stars have come out but i wish they would wait
                  praying for some kind of shelter there’s nowhere to hide
                  too many of us are running away from the things deep inside
                  inside (hums)
                  
                  people around you they try to relate
                  won’t leave you alone keep on calling your phone
                  but there’s nothing to say
                  when time is on hold i get wrapped up in thoughts 
                  that don’t do much but keep me inside
                  praying for some kind of shelter there’s nowhere to hide
                  
                  winter goes on
                  i make it mine
                  can’t do me wrong
                  you won’t sleep right, won’t sleep right
                  i open my wings to the sky
                  into the dark of the night
                  i’ll fly
                  
                  too many nights i don’t know if i’m alive
                  too many nights i don’t know
                  but this movie is starting to roll
                  and i’m playing the starring role
                  fear my old friend, i can’t stay
                  it’s time that we went our own ways
                  i’m ready to go
                  and though it’s looking cold
                  this coat works for me and i hope you like drinking alone, alone, alone
                  
                  walk in the room like a gangster
                  don’t ever question my hunger
                  destiny calls and i answer
                  she told me that i could be stronger
                  like winter, yeah i’m so numb
                  anxiety is falling off
                  nobody like me, i’m all alone
                  here in the ring i can do anything
                  i been doin’ okay
                  mindin’ my lane
                  i got music on my brain and i didn’t come here to play
                  this **** ain’t new to me oh no i breathe melodies
                  meditate on my dreams
                  elevate every chance that i receive
                  oh, i’m moving forward
                  i’m on the road
                  now i’m smiling and that’s cause i know
                  there’s only one way this can go
                  prepare for the storm
                  
                  walk in the room like a gangster
                  don’t ever question my hunger, no
                  don’t ever question that ****, don’t even
                  don’t even question me
                  no, no, no, no.

                <p class="lyrics off">love’s an illusion
                  one i’m inside
                  threw down my guard then 
                  gave you the knife
                  i was mistaken
                  i was mistaken, oh
                  
                  dancing in moonlight
                  dressed to the nines
                  mapping locations i thought we would fly
                  but i didn’t know that your heart was vacant
                  until you stole my last life
                  
                  what is love? cause i’m all ears
                  oh what is love without the tears?
                  is it just a word i borrowed
                  or did i make it up?
                  what would you call it then
                  when we know we’re more than friends
                  when you sell me all your dreams
                  and i give you everything?
                  
                  i’ve been losing sleep
                  and my peace of mind
                  went from counting sheep to counting lies
                  no more story telling
                  no more second chances
                  no more fantasizing that we’ll run away
                  leave all this behind
                  we’ll use a fake ID to buy us some time
                  you tell me tomorrow
                  but somewhere in my brain
                  i know that to you this is all just a game
                  
                  what is love? cause i’m all ears
                  what is love without the tears?
                  i confess i’m starting to think i made it up, love…
                  what would you call it then
                  when we know we’re more than friends?
                  i should draw the line cause the one we have is blurry
                  
                  sorry, sorry, sorry
                  sorry for the ********
                  sorry i don’t need you
                  and sorry that i’m done with this
                  sorry i’m not sorry 
                  for putting things so bluntly
                  the way you think you’re tough
                  you’re scared to love
                  in case it ends
                  in case it ends.

                  and i try to be patient
                  stethoscope to my racing heart
                  i’m getting close to the wasteland
                  
                  getting closer and closer 
                  i think i’m spilling over
                  my feelings are rising 
                  go on and sound the siren
                  feeling dangerous
                  found myself a ride or die
                  keep him nameless 
                  i gotta watch that evil eye
                  
                  no box can contain me
                  don’t blame me for blurring your dead lines
                  i’m tucking the demons in under the rubble it’s bedtime
                  get out of my head and into the tomb
                  off with the gloves, call up the wolves
                  and tell them the empress has got a new groove (skrrr)
                  and while i’m plotting my moves
                  let ‘em know that i make up the rules
                  never watching the views
                  i’m so hungry i’m eating for two
                  there’s room here for you
                  there’s room for me too
                  i hate that the women think winning involves competition, it’s dumb
                  i can’t help but feel that the men shouldn’t get to have all of the fun
                  get out of your way 
                  i’m talking to you
                  what do you say?
                  who could you be?
                  look in the mirror and who do you see?
                  
                  the sky gets so dark
                  but i find peace in the moon
                  reminder in the rock
                  the sun will be back soon
                  and i try to be patient
                  stethoscope to my racing heart
                  i’m getting close to the wasteland
                  
                  sweeter things will come and go
                  but cavities and calories suppressing my desire
                  when the lights all gone in the wasteland pearly eyes just can’t see a thing
                  clinging to our hope as we roam the open plane 
                  that we will see the light of day
                  
                  (hums)
                  
                  the sky gets so dark
                  but i find peace in the moon
                  reminder in the rock
                  the sun will be back soon
                  and i try to be patient
                  stethoscope to my racing heart
                  i’m getting close to the wasteland.

                  if i cried wolf in a world of lies
                  would you laugh or trust me?
                  cross my heart and i’ll take what’s mine
                  no modus vivendi
                  
                  i won’t fall
                  no looking down
                  i only take orders from above
                  i met my god 
                  then she said welcome back
                  
                  riders outside but their eyes are empty
                  as they try to shoot me blind
                  devil starts to cry cause his words don’t tempt me
                  demons sent to hunt me lose their mind
                  
                  and the sirens are sounding the moment i get back
                  all the things i’ve been through just for taking my soul back
                  and i’m trying my best not to show that i’m shaking
                  from the look on their faces i know that they won’t
                  take it from me
                  won’t take it from me, from me, from me, from me
                  take it from me
                  i’ll never be sorry, sorry, sorry,

                  i gotta keep it on the low tonight
                  posters say i’m wanted but i know they don’t want me
                  they can degrade me all they like
                  but no one can touch my energy
                  
                  i won’t fall

                <p class="lyrics off">i breathe
                  i am alone again
                  the leaves, my friends
                  they all go in the end
                  i let them go, i don’t hold on
                  cause i know better than to try and fight the weather on my own
                  
                  i breathe
                  and i pray that one day
                  i’ll find a better way
                  when the world ain’t so loud
                  and my mind’s a little less tired
                  i’ll find remedies to all these wounds that i’ve acquired
                  so i have faith even when i’m in doubt
                  that all of my dreams are gonna work out
                  unlikely as it seems, brushing dust of the shelf
                  i might just need a moment to remind myself
                  
                  i breathe
                  i am alone again
                  the leaves, my friends
                  they all go in the end
                  i let them go, i don’t hold on
                  cause i know better than to try and fight the weather on my own
                  
                  i breathe
                  and feel, as the waves slowly recede
                  back to ripples in the stream
                  glitching pixels on the screen won’t stop me seeing
                  the light as darkness fades
                  the smile upon your face
                  when nothing hurts anymore, anymore
                  so i feel free, i’m alone
                  and no matter where i go i know that i’m home
                  i just need a moment to take it slow
                  
                  i breathe 
                  i am alone again
                  the leaves, my friends
                  they all go in the end
                  i let them go, i don’t hold on
                  cause i know better than to try and fight the weather on my own
                  
                  (interlude)
                  
                  so i sing this song and i hope i’ll find
                  a way to get through the night
                  cause if i close my eyes
                  i’m afraid i might not breathe.
